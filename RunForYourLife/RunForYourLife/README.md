### Installation
 Requires the latest version of [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx). After BepInEx has been installed, drag `RunForYourLife.dll` into the `BepInEx/plugins` folder in the game's root directory. You will need to run the game once for the `RunForYourLife.cfg` file to generate.

### Config Options
Located in `BepInEx/config/RunForYourLife.cfg`

### To-Do

- Add adjustable exhaustion (time needed before you can hold sprint again if you let go).
- Create interface mod seperately for Coroner by EliteMasterEric to show cause of death.
- Possibly add rate of stamina regen to config.
- Possibly add exhaustion duration to config.
- Rework damage interval system to work for values below 0.1 and accurately reflect changes in config.
